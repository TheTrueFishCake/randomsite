<h1>What is this?</h3>
<p>This website serves as a portfolio of random knowledge. <br>
Just some random things like:  strategies for games, guides, and other things. <br>
This is mainly intended for personal use, and use by friends. Feel free to use as you like, stranger.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>I often make text files on my computer just to keep notes,<br>
    but sometimes, I forget to take those notes, and they often get very scattered.<br>
    So, I've decided on making a simple bookmarkable website that I can access in my browser.<br>
    It also helps if I need to share a file or other thing with my friend, and having this instead of a google drive file is much easier.

<h1>Why make it public?</h1>
<p>Some projects I've made I would say are good enough to be considered releasable, <br>
    and I hate having to deal with limitations from websites like steam or itch. <br>
    So, having a fully customizable website was my chosen solution.<br>
    If I ever make a game that requires a payment, I <b>will not release it here.</b><br>
    I will definetly post updates and other announcements here though.
