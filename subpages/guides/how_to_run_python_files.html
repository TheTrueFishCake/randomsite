<h1>How to run python files</h1>
<p>If you didn't already know, I have a page on this website where I made a game in python/pygame.<br>
    The link is <a href="../downloads/pongPage.html">here</a> if you want to check it out. <br>
    However, when you try to run it, you will likely get an error or get sent to notepad.<br>
    This guide aims to guide you through the process of installing python, and running python scripts.<br>
    Now lets get started!

<br>
<p>First, you can go to the official python website, and find the most recent version of python.<br>
    As of writing this, 3.12.8 is the most recent version. <br>
    If you want, you can just click <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.8/python-3.12.8-amd64.exe">here</a> and get the installer for this version.<br>
    If you don't want to get that version, click <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a> and find the most recent version of python.<br>

<br>
<h3>What the download section of a version looks like</h6>
<br>
<p>
    Simply scroll down and find the part where it says versions, and click download on one of them.<br>
    Afterwards, scroll almost all the way down, and click whichever installer works for you.<br>
    After, run the installer, and follow the instructions it gives.<br>
    Once it finishes installing, python files should automatically run, instead of opening it in notepad.<br>
    If not, right click the python file you want to run, and press "open with" and then "choose another app."<br>
    Just scroll through the app list, until you find "Python" then select it, and press always so it always does that.<br>
    Hope this helped!
