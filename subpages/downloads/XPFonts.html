<h5>What is this?</h5>
<p>This is a download for all of the preinstalled fonts in Windows XP.<br>
    I made a virtual machine, then extracted the fonts from the operating system's folder.<br>
    I have tried to organize all of them as best I can, but some of their names can get very confusing!<br>
    Below is a download for all of the fonts in their respective file formats.
