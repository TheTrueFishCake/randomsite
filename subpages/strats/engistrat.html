<h3>This is one of many strats for the engineer in tf2. Feel free to remix this to your liking!</h3>
<p>The concept for this is to be able to defend your intelligence/point, while still being able to leave and get kills</p>
<h2>Loadout</h2>
<p>Wrench: The Eureka Effect<br>
    Secondary Weapon: The Wrangler<br>
    Primary Weapon: The Widowmaker<br>
    You can use any variant of these, but you still need these weapons to some extent.

<h2>Key</h2>
<p>
    Red = The Intelligence<br>
    <br>
    Blue = Teleporter<br>
    Green = Sentry<br>
    Orange = Dispenser
</p>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>I used the tf2 intel room for this, but you can honestly use this anywhere where you have a corner<br>
    First, make sure your teleporter, sentry, and dispenser are max level. <b>DO NOT CONSTRUCT A TELEPORTER ENTRANCE</b><br>
    Once you have made the layout, you can just go and attack the enemy team.<br>
    When you get the heads-up that your sentry is attacking something, use The Eureka Effect, and teleport to your teleporter exit.<br>
    Use your wrangler once you arrive, and finish off whoever is attacking your sentry.<br>
    Repeat.
</p>
<h3>BONUS TIPS</h3>
<p>
    Your dispenser and sentry are a wall! Use that to your advantage!<br>
    If needed, leave your sentry-dispenser barrier, and scare the enemy out with your Widowmaker!
