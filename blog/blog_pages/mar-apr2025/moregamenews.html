<h1>More Game News - 2025-03-10</h1>
<p>More news on my game, friends!<br>
    First, on my <a href="youtube.com/@fishcaketf2">youtube channel</a> I have started uploading occasional videos of me testing game features.<br>
    Next, I have added random level generation (then reworked one hour later.) I have also started working on adding food items and decor to the various rooms<br>
    Next, I want to add a basic "enemy" to hunt the player.<br>
    Normally, you rarely come across the "workers" but, at an interval of (3 minutes? Maybe it should change depending on the difficulty?) overtime is activated.<br>
    The whole concept, is that Avarus Inc. <b>hates</b> paying workers overtime, and must remove workers that go against their wishes.<br>
    During "overtime" more workers arrive to remove the [player] so that Mr. Avarus doesn't need to give a larger cheque out.
