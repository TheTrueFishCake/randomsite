<h1>A quick thanks</h1>
<p><b>This is a quick thank you letter I typed up, so enjoy</b></p>
<p>First, thanks for getting me to 45 subscribers on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDZEJpbFfO6x8OEsiJcmLNA">youtube channel!</a><br>
    This really means alot, because I only have a few videos, and I still have gotten large amounts of attention (considering my channel size)<br>
    I also have been getting more than 100 views on most of my videos in less than a day, which is a HUGE accomplishment for me!<br>
    <b>TLDR;</b> Thanks alot!
</p>
