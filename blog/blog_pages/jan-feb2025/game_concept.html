<h1>Game concept - 2025-01-29</h1>
<p>
    Recently, I have had an idea for a game.<br>
    This game is going to be endless, and have an office theme.<br>
    Below is an "idea sheet" where I wrote down whatever came to mind.
</p>
<img src="../../../images/concept_page.png">
<p>I will give updates in the future on this game's development</p>
<p>Ballpoint pens should not need to be dragged across a paper that much<br>
    so they can start writing.
