<p>
    I have managed to implement a basic player controller, (movement)<br>
    as well as added a basic hunger, thirst, and health system.<br>
    Pretty simple.<br>
    3 levels of difficulty; Easy, Medium, Hard<br>
    Each difficulty dictates how much of each stat you lose over time, and how quickly you lose it.<br>
    Gonna add a basic system to be able to pick up items to increase stats.<br>
    Until next time!
