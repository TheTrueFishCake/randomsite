<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
    Hello, my name is [REDACTED], otherwise known as Fishcake/FishcakeTF2. I am into coding in C#, Python, and HTML, although I mainly focus on Unity for coding (so C#.)<br>
    Feel free to call me:
    <ul>
        <li>Fish</li>
        <li>Cakes</li>
        <li>Fishcake</li>
    </ul>
    I am a relativly experienced C# game developer and 3D modeler.
</p>

<h1>About my Youtube channel</h1>
<p>
    For content creation, I mainly stream or upload videos on the game Team Fortress 2.<br>
    I also use my channel for uploading and archiving recordings of me testing features in games I make. <br>
    For example, I uploaded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A226Sf3pDQ&t">this</a> video showcases me testing my game's food spawning.<br>
    For now, I will not have commentary in my videos.
</p>
